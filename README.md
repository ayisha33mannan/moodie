# Moodie Mood Mood
A fun interactive website where users can select a mood, and the theme and music change accordingly.

# What I've learned
This project was built to apply the JS knowledge I have learned so far. Here is what I have implemented:
- Modern JavaScript practices
- Use of querySelector instead of getElementById
- Switch statements
- Dynamic theme changes based on user mood
- Audio control with progress bar interaction
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
